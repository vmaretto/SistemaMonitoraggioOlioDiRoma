# Overview

The Sistema Monitoraggio Olio (Oil Monitoring System) is a comprehensive reputation monitoring and label verification platform designed for the Consorzio Olio Roma-Lazio. The system focuses on monitoring online reputation, tracking mentions of oil-related brands, and implementing an inspector activity tracking workflow for quality control reports.

The application serves as a centralized hub for analyzing online content sentiment, managing keywords for brand monitoring, and handling the complete lifecycle of quality inspection reports through a state machine-based workflow system.

## Recent Changes

- **October 12, 2025**: âœ… **COMPLETED Migration from AbacusAI to OpenAI GPT-5 + Performance Optimization**
  - Replaced all AbacusAI integrations with OpenAI GPT-5 and GPT-5 Vision
  - Implemented dual-layer label verification: 50% textual matching + 50% visual similarity
  - Added per-label textual comparison with `compareTextWithOfficialLabel()`
  - Enhanced visual matching with `compareLabelsVisually()` using GPT-5 Vision
  - Migrated sentiment analysis to OpenAI GPT-5 with structured JSON responses
  - Updated database schema to support data URL storage (TEXT fields) for uploaded images
  
  **ðŸš€ Performance Optimization (Final)**:
  - **Ultra-fast verification**: Reduced visual comparisons from 12 â†’ 1 (only best textual match)
  - **Two-phase approach**: Textual pre-selection across all labels â†’ visual comparison on winner
  - **API timeout**: Extended to 120 seconds for complex OpenAI Vision calls
  - **Detailed logging**: Step-by-step console logs (OCR, conformity, matching, finalization)
  - **User feedback**: Real-time progress bar with 5 step messages during analysis
  - **Estimated time**: 30-40 seconds per verification (vs. previous timeout issues)
  - **Frontend timeout**: 120s AbortController with proper cleanup and error handling
  - Removed legacy AbacusAI code and deprecated functions

- **December 28, 2025**: Completed full implementation of Inspector Activity Tracking ("TracciabilitÃ  attivitÃ  ispettori")
- **Major Feature**: Complete workflow system for managing quality inspection reports from initial analysis through final closure
- **Database Extension**: Extended Prisma schema with 6 new models (Report, ActionLog, Inspection, ClarificationRequest, AuthorityNotice, Attachment)
- **API Suite**: Implemented 12+ RESTful API endpoints with full validation and state transition management
- **User Interface**: Added comprehensive UI with dashboard integration, report listing, and detailed workflow management
- **State Management**: Enforced workflow state machine with proper transition validation and audit trail
